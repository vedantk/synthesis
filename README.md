### Synthesis 

Ideas:

-	Microphone, MIDI, WAV input -> sound.

-	Sound -> generative models -> new music.

-	Compositions -> fragment generators, transition generators -> new compositions.

-	(New) compositions -> new music.

- 	Can you learn patterns in music by running Runge-Kutta on a PCM buffer and building Markov chains out of the result?

- 	Robots!
